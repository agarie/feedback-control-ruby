# Feedback control in Ruby

This repository houses the Ruby translations for the examples in the book
[Feedback Control for Computer
Systems](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028970.do) by Philipp K.
Janert.


I'm not entirely sure what kind of licensing would be appropriate, given that
these files are, in essence, a couple notes I wrote while reading the
aforementioned book. Thus I defaulted to the MIT license.¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## What's that book about?

[Feedback Control for Computer
Systems](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028970.do) is an informative,
hands-on book about how control theory applies to discrete, software-based
systems.
